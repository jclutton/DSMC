# Safety Assessments for All Participants: Tables and Listing 

## CTCAE 5.0 Criteria

**Grades**  

Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline:  

- **Grade 1** Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  

- **Grade 2** Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL*.  

- **Grade 3** Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL**.  

- **Grade 4** Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  

- **Grade 5** Death related to AE.  


**Relatedness**  

Relatedness refers to the relationship of the AE to the intervention. COMET rates relatedness from not related to definitely related.

- **Not Related** The AE is clearly NOT related to the intervention 

- **Possibly Related** The AE may be related to the intervention  

- **Definitely Related** The AE is clearly related to the intervention

**Definitions**  

- **Adverse Event** Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject participant, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research.

- **Event of Interest** Incidental findings or events uncovered during baseline testing not directly attributable to the study. It is often unclear if the event is new onset. Most are pre-existing and asymptomatic i.e., asymptomatic ST segment depression on a maximal exercise test. 

- **System Organ Class (SOC)** The highest level of the MedDRA1 hierarchy, also referred to as System Organ Classe (SOC), is identified by anatomical or physiological system, etiology, or purpose (e.g., SOC Investigations for laboratory test results). CTCAE terms are grouped by MedDRA Primary SOCs. Within each SOC, AEs are listed and accompanied by descriptions of severity (Grade). 

- **Preferred Term** A term that is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific analyses. Each CTCAE v4.0 term is a MedDRA LLT (Lowest Level Term).
