This project works is still under development. Instructions to come. 

Data and safety monitor reporting is a necessary, but time-intensive process for clinical trials. We built a tool that integrates flexible REDCap instruments, that naturally fit into the data entry workflow, with an RStudio project. The tool automatically produces data and safety monitor reports, customizable by clinical trial, with features like consort diagrams, enrollment data, and safety analyses, saving time and facilitating better trial quality monitoring.
